    "# Fourier Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fourier transform is a mathematical transformation that takes an existing function and decomposes it into an infinite series of sine or cosine waves of different periods and phases.  It has many uses in science (and in everyday life, as we'll see).  This tutorial will not discuss much of the mathematics behind the transform, but instead today we will concentrate on getting a better intuitive understanding of what Fourier transforms represent, and some ways they can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's useful to define a few terms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous functions (e.g. mathematical functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function can be decomposed into a *Fourier series*, an infinite sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies.  (Another way to say this is that the set of sines and cosines of all frequencies is a complete basis set.) The coefficients of this infinite series for a given function are called the *Fourier coefficients* of that function.   The mathematical operation of determining these coefficients for a particular function is called a *Fourier transform*, which we'll refer to as FT for short. The *inverse Fourier transform* is (as the name implies) the inverse process, which when applied to the Fourier series, recovers the original function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Discrete data points (samples of functions at particular points)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're dealing with experimental data, we generally do not have continuous sampling of our function of interest.  For example, we might have time samples from observing a particular phenomenon at regular intervals.  This is also the case with digital representations of continuous waveforms, for example a digital audio file containing a certain number of samples of the audio waveform each second.  In this case, we need a slightly different mathematical operation, one that can operate on a discrete set of datapoints rather than on a function.  This operation is called a *discrete Fourier transform*, or DFT.  This operation can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets, so people have settled upon a particularly efficient implementation of the discrete Fourier transform, called the *fast Fourier transform*, or FFT.  This is so common that \"FFT\" is sometimes used as being synonymous with \"discrete Fourier transform\". \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Time domain vs. Frequency domain\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of Fourier transforms is that the transform and inverse transform take us back and forth between different \"spaces\" or \"domains\".  This is easiest to see by considering an example.  If we have a dataset that is a function of time, then each point in our dataset represents the data at one particular time, e.g. 1 second, 2 seconds, etc.  When we Fourier transform that dataset, then each point in our new dataset represents the behavior of the data at one particular *frequency*, e.g. 1 Hz, 2 Hz, etc.  Note here that frequency is the inverse of time.  And in general it is true that each point in the FT has the inverse units of each point in the original data.  If our dataset represents spatial samples (e.g. elevation as a function of position, in units of meters), then the FT points will have units of 1/meters, i.e. they are *spatial* frequency.   The idea of spatial frequency might seem odd, but it is exactly analogous to temporal frequency.  Each point in that spatial FT represents the coefficient (amplitude and phase) of a sinusoidal wave with a particular wavelength, and how big or small it would have to be to add up to some particular rolling landscape.  Quickly varying terrain would need high (large) spatial frequencies, while slowly varying terrain would need low (small) spatial frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, implicit in this domain-switching idea is a key concept of Fourier analysis, and something that gives it much of its power:  any *one* point in one domain affects the *whole dataset* in the other domain.  This is perhaps easiest to see in going from time to frequency.  If I have a signal that is a pure sine wave, and I Fourier transform it, I only get one non-zero Fourier component, at whatever frequency point is need to represent that signal.  If I now change one other point in the Fourier transform(i.e. in the frequency domain) to be non-zero, and then transform back to the time domain, I have changed the whole signal, because I have added a second sinusoidal component, which will show up at *all* time points.   We'll experiment with this below. "

Set the keyword \"endpoint=False\" to avoid duplicating the zero point at the end.  Calculate the sine of these time points, using a sine wave with a frequency of 0.5 Hz.
