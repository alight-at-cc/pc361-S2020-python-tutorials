    "Sometimes physical systems consist of many parameters that are not well known, or that evolve over time in unpredictable ways.  Magnetic spins, diffuse light scattering, and electron gases are all examples of systems that can better be modeled using Monte Carlo methods, so named because the randomness involved <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#History\">reminded Nicholas Metropolis</a> of gambling at the famous casino in Monte Carlo, in Monaco. (Metropolis and his colleagues were working at Los Alamos shortly after the end of World War II, and modeling neutron transport through materials.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In lab today we will explore these methods by modeling how light scatters through biological tissue. As you might imagine, understanding this is important for understanding different kinds of medical imaging.  Light scattering is a natural use of Monte Carlo methods, because in many cases, when an atom or molecule absorbs a photon, a short time later it re-emits a photon in a random direction, retaining no memory of the initial direction of the photon.  We can model this behavior by generating random numbers and using them to specify the direction and distance that the photon travels.  In some cases, there *is* some memory of the photon's initial direction (e.g. it is more likely to scatter forward than backward).  As we will see, we can also model such cases by specifying a non-uniform distribution (with whatever functional form suits the particular situation) for the new direction; this is called the *phase function* of the scattering.

    "However, nothing a computer does is truly random, so these are more technically termed \"pseudo-random\" numbers.  For most purposes these are plenty random enough for anything we want to do, but if your analysis depends heavily on them, it is good to be aware of the strength (i.e. randomness) of the random number generator in the language you're using.  In particular, some algorithms will always give you the same pseudo-random sequence unless you are careful to alter the \"seed\" given to the algorithm.

If there were no scattering or absorption, the image of the light coming out would be the same as it was going in, i.e. a relatively compact point source.  (\"No scattering or absorption\" is another way of saying \"transparent\", so just think of shining a light through a pane of glass.)  However, if there *is* some scattering, the image will change. (Think about the same example, but with a frosted pane of glass rather than a clear one.)  Being able to model how the image changes as it passes through tissue helps diagnosticians understand what the tissue properties are, since, e.g., a tumor might have different light scattering or absorption properties than healthy tissue. \n",
