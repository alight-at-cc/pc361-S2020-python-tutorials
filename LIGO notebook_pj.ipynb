    "## Analysis of Gravitational Wave data from LIGO\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to follow the analysis of the LIGO data showing the first detection of gravitational waves.  You can find more information here:  https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW150914/   This notebook is based on one produced by the LIGO Open Science Center, https://losc.ligo.org/about/ , which has a variety of resources for learning about analyzing LIGO data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to download the two datafiles at these links:\n",

    "Save those files in the same directory as this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The names of the files tell us about the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"H-H1\" means that the data come from the LIGO Hanford Observatory site and the LIGO \"H1\" datector;\n",
    "\n",
    "* the \"4\" means the strain time-series data are (down-)sampled from 16384 Hz to 4096 Hz.  There are also corresponding versions that haven't been binned, which have a \"32\" in place of the \"4\" there. \n",
    "\n",
    "* the \"V1\" means version 1 of this data release;\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"1126257414-4096\" means the data starts at GPS time 1126257414 (Mon Sep 14 09:16:37 GMT 2015), duration 4096 seconds; NOTE: GPS time is number of seconds since Jan 6, 1980 GMT. See http://www.oc.nps.edu/oc2902w/gps/timsys.html or https://losc.ligo.org/gps/\n",

    "Helpfully, the LIGO team has also released a set of python functions to read the LIGO data.  However, they were written for Python 2 only, and some of you are running Python 3.  If you have Python 2 (look in the upper-right-hand corner of this notebook) then you can grab the LIGO original version: \n",

    "\n",
    "Our next step is to read in the data using a function in `readligo` called `loaddata`, which returns the strain data, the time data, and a dictionary file of data quality channels.  Dictionaries are a type of python data, where instead of integer indices like arrays, the data in a dictionary can be accessed by key, which can be strings, numbers, or tuples.\n"

Note that you'll need to look at the code in `readligo.py` to see what input parameters that function takes, and what it returns (so that you can \"catch\" the return values appropriately in different variables; remember that a function can return more than one thing, so you want to have an appropriate number of variables on the left-hand side of the function call). \n",

Plot the power spectral density of both H1 and L1 between 10 and 2000 Hz.
