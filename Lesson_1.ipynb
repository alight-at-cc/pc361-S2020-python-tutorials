Write a function that takes a numpy array of $x$ values and returns an array with the corresponding $y$ values for your chosen function. Choose your $x$ values to be between bounds that are easy to integrate over.  Write a function that takes your $x$ and $y$ arrays as input, and uses the trapezoidal rule to return the value of the integral $\\int_{a}^{b}\\, f(x)\\,dx$.  Print out the value of your integral, and calculate the percent error compared to the analytic solution.
